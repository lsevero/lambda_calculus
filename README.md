# lambda_calculus

A small study on lambda calculus using clojure (but any lisp would do just fine).

I tried to keep thing closest to the form using just lambda functions with only 1 argument, although this can become unreadable pretty quickly.
I haven't used church numeral on everthing because again, this is just a study and using church numerals everywhere would make things very complicated.
